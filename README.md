# sharepap
I am working on a platform that will allow users to share article to my platform. It has 70% resemblance to Medium.com

<a href="http://sharepap.com">Sharepap.com</a> is a whole round system that will accommodate all post types. Be it anniversaries, events, obituaries and news articles and sponsored stories. 


<a href="http://reviewstabloid.com" target="_blank" rel="dofollow">Reviews Tabloid</a> is our main blog which will be a subsidiary of the Sharepap. 

You can contribute in any way possible both code and finances through this <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=FZXWAFHYT4F52">link</a>.
